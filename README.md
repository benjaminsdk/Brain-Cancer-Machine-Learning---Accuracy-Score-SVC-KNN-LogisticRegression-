# Brain-Cancer-Machine-Learning---Accuracy-Score-SVC-KNN-LogisticRegression-

## Setup and Environment

pip install wheel

pip install pandas

## Machine Learning Models

1. SVC
2. KNN
3. Logistic Regression

## Objective of code

To determine which Machine Learning Models has higher accuracy in predicting Brain Cancer

## Approach

A data sample size of 0.3 was used for test while the remainer of the data is used for training.

Col 'y' in the file braincancer.csv with the values of 'Tumor' or 'Normal' was used as labelling.

## Results

1. Both KNN and Logistic Regression had an accuracy score of 1.0
2. SVC on the other hand had an accuracy output of ~0.45
